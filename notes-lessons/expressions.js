// What is an expression?
// Variables, strings, functions calls/execution (NOT CALLBACKS), numbers, addition of expressions, comparison (===, <, >, are comparison expressions that result in a boolean value)

const input = require("./input")


//Variable expression example (note this is different from variable declarations and variable assignments):
poop

// string expression example:

"poop in a bucket"
"wii"
"afhdskjfgdskugfdskyjgfhakwhgfuh9w765rytyhiu"

//function call examples

input()

// numbers:

33
2
1000
0
-7
0.1

// addition of expressions:


"faith" + "one"

1 + 34

input() + "Steven was a butt face at the age of 18"

// input() always produces a string even if numbers/int/floats are typed in

// if variable is a number you can add it to a number
variable + 1 

// if variable is a string you can concatenate with another string
variable + "string"

// example of comparison expressions:

1 < 2

3284632874632 > 1

fish === 1 + 1 

//compares it alphabetically. if they both started with "s" it would move on to the next letter, etc.
"steven" > "sbeve"

"steve" === "ponda"






// Where can you use expressions?
// expressions can be used in the parenthesis of function calls (passed as arguments)
// and in variable assignments on the right side of the equal (=) sign
// can be used in the parenthesis of an if statement and while loop
// can be used on either side of the plus (+) sign
// can be used on either side of the comparison (===, >, <) expressions

// example of expression being used in the parenthesis of a function call:
console.log('Hello, World!')
console.log(sbeve)
console.log(1+1)

// example of variable assignments of the right side of the equal sign:
sbeve = "punda bubu"
steven = 1 + 1
myName = input()
cliff = 29 
johnny = cliff + 2


// example of expression being used in the parenthesis of an if statement

if (sbeve === steven) {
  console.log('you won the mile!')
}

//there are five expressions in the following if statements conditional
if (cliff+1 > 10) {
  console.log("you lost the mile")
}

while (cliff < johnny) {
  console.log("ha you activated my trap card: INFINITE PERMANENCE")
}
